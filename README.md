# Image Processing for Stochastic Class Discrimination

Classifier algorithm for images with accuracy evaluation. Class discrimination utilizes NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Linear, and
Quadratic discriminators. Currently in development.

## 1. Image Analysis

The first section of this project is designed to import and manipulate images of any format. More specifically, the set of images below were used as references for the algorithm.
